# NBA-Analyses

Analyses and visualizations of NBA players. All stats are scraped from basketball-reference.com, and all analysis/visualization is done using Pandas and Seaborn. The two main outputs are a heatmap of the player's shot attemps by location, and a box plot of the player's highest scoring season by month.
